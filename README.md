# Contribution


Please see open issues for a specific issue, and do not hesitate to open any new issue (like better code, readability, modularity and best practice, performance, better UI or even functionality enhancements...).

### Current priority: 

https://github.com/bacloud14/WeatherVenue/issues/1

Please know that I am not a keen NodeJS developer, but I successfully made this weather application. It is in its early stage and not proper for final service yet.

If you contribute, please consider that I can merge and publish a new release under one channel or another. It will be 100% free although I can add ads to generate some coffee expenses :)

If you want to maintain the project with me; You can always ask.

Please keep it fair if you want to deploy anywhere; Ask for permission.

Sweet coding !
